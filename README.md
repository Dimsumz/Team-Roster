# Team-Roster
The purpose of this app is to provide a User Interface to assist me as Swim Team Captain. 

The App will utilize dictionaries and a sorting algorithm connected to a scrollable table to display our top swimmers based off of inputted data from a spreadsheet. 

If I have enough time I would like to implement a delete/modify functionality to be able to change the swimmer's information/times without having to go into the source code as well.
